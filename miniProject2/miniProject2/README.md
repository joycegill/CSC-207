## Description
The programs "InteractiveCalculator.java" and "QuickCalculator.java" provide the users with two different ways to store and evaluate a function: by repeatedly reading in a line from the command line or asking the user to type one expression at the beginning. "BigFraction.java" creates a class BigFraction and contains the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. "BFCalculator.java" is the primary workhorse that contains the methods evaluate(String exp) which evaluates the given expression and store(char register) which stores the given number in the according register.
