### Descrption
The purpose of programs "CaesarCipher.java" and "VigenereCipher.java" is to allow users to encode and decode text through the Caesar Cipher and the Vigenere Cipher. 

#### Resources
Seunghyeon Kim - He helped me with the README.md file and using GitHub. 
StackOverflow - I used StackOverflow to look up the syntax of some Java methods and constructors

##### CaesarCipher
The program CaesarCipher.java contains 3 helpers - one to make sure that the letters stay within the bounds of lowercase letters; one to encrypt the given plaintext using the Caesar Cipher; and one to decrypt the given ciphertext using the Caesar Cipher. In the main class, I call upon those methods and also make sure that the user has typed in the correct number and type of command line arguments. 

##### VigenereCipher
The program VigenereCipher.java contains 4 helpers - one to make the key and the given plaintext the same length; one to make sure that the letters stay within the bounds of lowercase letters; one to encrypt the given plaintext using the Vigenere Cipher; and one to decrypt the given ciphertext using the Vigenere Cipher. In the main class, I call upon those methods and also make sure that the user has typed in the correct number and type of command line arguments.
